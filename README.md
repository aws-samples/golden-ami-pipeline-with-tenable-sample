## Golden AMI Pipeline with Tenable.io

Create a Golden AMI Pipeline integrated with a Tenable.io Scanner for vulnerability assessments of your AWS Amazon Machine Images(AMIs), and store approved images as Golden AMIs. This repository will also help you set up continuous monitoring of Amazon EC2 instances in your environment, and alert you in case an unapproved AMI is running. 

This repo contains resources for building a Golden AMI Pipeline with [AWS Systems Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/), [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/), [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [AWS CloudWatch Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/WhatIsCloudWatchEvents.html), [AWS Service Catalog](https://aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/), and the [tenable Scanner from AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01LXCD58S?qid=1575925595168&sr=0-1&ref_=srh_res_product_title).


## Overview
Here is the architecture diagram of the Golden AMI Creation process. For more details, please refer to the [Golden AMI Pipeline Set Up Guide](/resources/docs/Golden-AMI-Pipeline-Guide-Version1.3.docx).

5. Log in to [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01LXCD58S?qid=1571184129453&sr=0-1&ref_=srh_res_product_title) and subscribe to [Nessus Scanner (Pre-Authorized)](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01LXCD58S?qid=1571184129453&sr=0-1&ref_=srh_res_product_title). This is a Bring Your Own License(BYOL) product, and you will use the license from Step 1 to provision this scanner.

6. Please refer to the [AWS set up guide](https://docs.tenable.com/other/TenableioAWSIntegrationGuide.pdf) provided by Tenable to set up the pre-authorized scanner in your environment. Note the `Scanner Name` that you created using this process.
